From the error message of fuzzing some logins, we can see the direct sql query.

As a result, we can craft the following payload:

|          |           |
| -------- | --------- |
| Username | admin     |
| Password | "' OR 1=1 |

Login page looks to be another sql injection:

`java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended`

Now we can leverage a technique known as union injection:

Using the method above, we can fuzz the version as well as the tables. I then queried the WEB\_ADMINS table with the correct ordering of parameters(6 possible permutations) then logged into the admin portal

Then, I can upload a jsp reverse shell with [https://www.revshells.com/](https://www.revshells.com/) and get a system shell.
