# picoCTF - GDB Test Drive

## Overview&#x20;

Walkthrough of gdb and it's capabilities, including break main and run.&#x20;

### Basis

First off, let's change the permissions on the binary and run gdbme on it

Note that although it looks like we aren't analyzing gdbme, we are able to interact with it.&#x20;

This isn't much help, so let's convert to asm.

```
kali@kali:~/Downloads$(gdb) layout asm
```

Now we can see that in the address \*(main+99) we have a sleep function, which we want to skip. Create a breakpoint at that location, run the program, and then jump to \*(main+104), which is the next address in the program.

```
(gdb) break *(main+99)
(gdb) run
(gdb) jump *(main+104)
Continuing at 0x55555555532f.                                                                                         â”‚    1414:       c3                      ret
picoCTF{REDACTED}
```

Alternatively, we can also modify the binary file to remove the sleep part. First, we need to find the location of the instructions to sleep and remember the bytes.

<pre><code><strong>...
</strong><strong>132a:       e8 e1 fd ff ff          call   1110 &#x3C;sleep@plt>
</strong><strong>...
</strong></code></pre>

We can see the 5 bytes are e8 e1 fd ff ff. To overwrite them, we'll use a tool called hexedit.

```
kali@kali:~/Downloads$ hexedit gdbme
```

To look for our 5 bytes, we can hit / and then search for just E8 E1 FD FF FF. This jumps to the location, and we can write over the bytes with 90(which the program sees as a "nothing block"). Ctrl+X to save, and then run again to get the flag.
